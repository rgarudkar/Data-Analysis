Problem Statement
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable growth. This organisation hires you as a data analyst for this department to determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.
Now, I was provided with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which has different countries and regions' GDP, population, and other factors that might impact GDP/Capita. Using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can be referred to as "how a country can attain sustainable growth ".

1)PDF file containing Storytelling Documents: Please add all of your observations & insights in the form of a presentation that you have collected after performing data analysis. (Name it as “Insights_RamgopalGarudkar”)
2)Excel File for Analysis: Please compile this sheet with all the data analysis you have performed on the dataset. (Name it as “Final Analysis_RamgopalGarudkar”
3)Excel File for Formatting + Data Processing: Please compile this sheet with formatted and processed dataset. (Name it as “Processed Solution_RamgopalGarudkar”


Data Processing Procedure:
1)First step was to create a unique key and join the tables from all other sheets for analysis So here the search key should be common and unique among all the sheets. But by closely looking at the dataset you can see that there doesn’t exist any such key. Hence you need to create a Unique search key. To create unique keys for every sheet you can use those features which are available in all the sheets.Created a unique key : country/region and year

2)To merge different sheets you can take the help of VLookup.Vlookup Syntax: =VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorted])

3)Next step was to check for data types for all column and set it accordingly.

4)Then I had to handle with missing values In this case, you can not replace missing values with any other values like mean/median/zero, etc. because GDP is a critical value, and the GDP of a country changes over a period of time depending on various factors.Also whichever factors impact the GDP, will always have some value trend over a period. So because of this, any value which is missing in-between can not be replaced by zero or any aggregated method.To impute the value for the current year I took the previous year’s value for the same feature and region. Because for two consecutive years economic trends can be taken the same for the analysis. If the previous year’s value is also missing, then the best suitable practice, in that case, is to leave that cell.

5)Found the outliers for all the columns,Applied conditional formatting on alternate rows,Applied all the formatting such as : borders, the column name highlighted and bold and Created new features: GDP/ capita , CO2 emssion / capita, Energy consumption / capita, Tourism outbound / Capita.

Data Analysis Procedure:
1)I Performed Bivariate analysis between GDP / capita and other features.
2)I Performed Univariate Analysis with statistical values and histogram graph.
3)I also created a pivot table for getting some insights for different featues.

Story Telling Document
1)Created a final outcome power point presentation using all the insights.
